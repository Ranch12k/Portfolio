## 💡 Tips for Your Hybrid Profile (Laravel + Python)
Since you are a pro in Laravel but learning Python Automation:
1.  **Sell the "Efficiency" angle**: "I don't just build apps; I write scripts to automate the testing and data entry for those apps."
2.  **Highlight API knowledge**: Your deep understanding of REST APIs in Laravel makes you excellent at *consuming* APIs in Python/Playwright.
3.  **Showcase Integration**: Try to build a project where Laravel is the backend, and a Python script feeds it data (e.g., a scraper that saves data to your Laravel DB).
